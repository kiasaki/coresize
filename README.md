# coresize

_core, because it's simple, resize, because it serves resized versions of your images_

**coresize** aims to be a small server that can load images from local disk, S3,
or zip and serve resized and alligned versions of those images. Here's what it supports:

- Use local folder of images
- Pull down folder of images from S3
- Pull down folder of images from a `.zip` (not yet implemented)
- Serve over HTTP or HTTPS
- Specify width and height of new image
- Specify alignment of image in new canvas (t,b,l,r)
- Make the server respond to hashes based on original content instead of filenames
- Expose json hashes map at `/filenames.json`

## CLI usage

```
Usage of coresize:
  -aws-client-key="": Only used when pull-from=s3
  -aws-secret-key="":
  -folder-name="files/": Local folder where images to serve are located and will be pulled to
  -force-pull=false: Force fetching images from remote
  -hash=false: Answer to hashed filenames
  -port=8080: Port to listen on
  -pull-from="": Either 's3' or 'http'
  -pull-from-url="": S3 location or http location
  -v=false: Be more verbose
```

## GET `/filenames.json`

Example response:

```json
